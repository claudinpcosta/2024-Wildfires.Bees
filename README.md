# 2024-Wildfires.Bees

## Contains all analyses performed on datasets regarding how wildfires impact bumble bee populations in Sierra Nevada, California.

### Synopsis

We examined the body sizes of bumble bees in a large, recently burned forest-meadow complex, specifically in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, to understand whether the habitat type (forest versus meadow) mediates the impact of fire on bee size. We detected evidence that bees are larger in recently burned areas, irrespective of habitat type.

### Sample Information
_see [Seki.dataset.csv](Data/Seki.dataset.csv) for all bee data and see [Site.Information.csv](Data/Site.Information.csv) for site information._

### Analysis
_see [Burned.PilotProject.Script.R](Burned.PilotProject.Script.R) for codes, and we can find the input in the folder [Data](Data)._
